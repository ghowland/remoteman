## RemoteMan

Remote machine manager, puts custom configuration files and directories on servers. A post-system configuration recurring management tool.

In the AutoOps process, this would come after [Sysync](https://github.com/ghowland/sysync) and before [DeployMan](https://github.com/ghowland/deployman).

Documents to come once the code has stabilized.
